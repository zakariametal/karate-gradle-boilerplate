## Description

Automation tests (API tests / integration tests / performance tests) using the [Karate](https://intuit.github.io/karate/) framework. Reuse your `.feature` files between different types of tests!

## Execute API tests / integration tests

Options:

- `SIM_FEATURE` - Which karate feature files to use for loadtesting. Default = everything

```
./gradlew clean test
```

Or with selected feature files:

```
./gradlew clean test -DSIM_FEATURE=automation/example.feature
```

- `Dkarate.env` - With which environment configuration to run test.Details of environment name and configuration can be found in karate-config.js.

```
./gradlew clean test -DSIM_FEATURE=automation/example.feature -Dkarate.env=stg
```
